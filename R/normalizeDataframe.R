# "Normalizes" a data.frame with respect to column types.
# This is necessary for comparing data.frames written to Excel and then
# read back in from Excel.
#
# Note that Excel does not know e.g. factor types. Factor variables
# in fact are written to Excel as ordinary strings. Therefore, when read
# back in to R, they are treated as character variables.
#
# 'normalizeDataframe' is used for RUnit tests to compare data.frame's
# written to and read from Excel
