# Saving Microsoft Excel workbooks
#
# A workbook's underlying Excel file is not saved (or being created in case the 
# file did not exist and create = TRUE has been specified) unless the saveWorkbook
# method has been called on the object. This provides more flexibility to the user 
# to decide when changes are saved and also provides better performance in that 
# several changes can be written in one go (normally at the end, rather than after 
# every operation causing the file to be rewritten again completely each time). This 
# is due to the fact that workbooks are manipulated in-memory and are only written 
# to disk with specifically calling saveWorkbook.
