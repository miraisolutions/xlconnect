```

Justification: XLConnect uses a java component which we maintain in a separate project, as well as Apache POI 4.1.x and its dependencies. At install time, the presence of these dependencies in the correct version is checked; if missing, they are downloaded into XLConnect's installation directory. Apache POI 4.1.x is not yet available from major distributions' package managers at the time of writing. In addition, the full ooxml-schemas-1.4.jar is required, which is not distributed via package managers. See [The POI FAQ](https://poi.apache.org/help/faq.html#faq-N10109) for more information.

Justification: the first linked website has an invalid certificate, the other seems to uses cloudflare DDoS protection,
which results in a redirect when accessing the URL.
