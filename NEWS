0.2-4 2013-01-31
  * Ability to read cached cell values. There is a new argument useCachedValues
    to methods readWorksheet and readNamedRegion. This is especially useful for
    cells with complex formulas that XLConnect (Apache POI) cannot evaluate and
    so far would have resulted in NAs being returned. With this new option
    XLConnect can now read the cached values of cells.
  * There are new arguments keep and drop to readWorksheet and readNamedRegion
    which allow filtering of columns before the data is imported to R. This can
    result in much better performance compared to importing the full data to R
    and then doing the subsetting in R.
  * String conversions when reading in data from Excel (readWorksheet, readNamedRegion)
    now respect the data format of the cells
  * Support for numeric missing value identifiers (see method setMissingValue)
  * New Vignette "XLConnect for the Impatient" to get people started quickly
  * Added a new function getLastColumn to query the last non-empty column in a
    worksheet
  * The bounding box detection algorithm for readWorksheet has been adapted to better
    deal with leading and trailing rows and columns of blank cells. In addition, new
    arguments autofitRow and autofitCol have been introduced that allow removal of
    leading and trailing rows and columns even in case boundaries have been specified
    by the user. This is useful in situations where the data is expected within certain
    given boundaries but the exact location is not known.
  * Exposed setCellStyle(formula, cellstyle) to be able to set a cellstyle on a whole
    region for improved performance. Note that there is a slight API change to the
    setCellStyle method.
  * Fixed an issue with writing empty data.frames
  * Moved to Apache POI 3.9 (see package XLConnectJars)
  * Ensured vignette compatibility with ggplot2 0.9.3

0.2-3 2012-11-05
  * Fixed issue when trying to write empty data.frame with writeNamedRegion and
    writeNamedRegionToFile
  * Fixed issue in package vignette sample code
  * Added vectorization for rownames argument in readWorksheet, readNamedRegion, 
    writeWorksheet and writeNamedRegion

0.2-2 2012-10-15
  * Fixed issue in package vignette sample code
	
0.2-1 2012-08-15
  * Fixed issue with overwriting cells of different type
  * Fixed issue with failing unit tests on R-devel
    (issue with Excel date/time values and increased precision of
    all.equal for POSIXct)
  * Added new methods for clearing cells from a sheet, a named region
    or a range (clearSheet, clearNamedRegion, clearRange, clearRangeFromReference)

0.2-0 2012-07-18
  * Moved to Apache POI 3.8
  * Fixed lazy evaluation issues with S4 generics. Generic methods
    now fully expand the argument list in order to have the
    arguments immediately evaluated.
  * readWorksheet now returns a _named_ list if more than one worksheet
    is read. This provides convenient access to the corresponding data
    by list subsetting.
  * readWorksheet and readNamedRegion now provide a new argument named
    'check.names' that controls whether data.frame column names are
    checked for syntactically valid variable names (see the 'check.names'
    argument of data.frame).
  * Support for setting the color of worksheet tabs via the setSheetColor
    method (only for *.xlsx files).		
  * Support for freeze panes and split panes.
  * Removing dependency to tikzDevice package
  * Updates to the package vignette. Package vignette code examples can
    be found in the XLConnect.R script file in the top level library
    directory or by typing edit(file = system.file("XLConnect.R", 
    package = "XLConnect"))
	
0.1-9 2012-03-08
  * Vignette examples now run with ggplot2 0.9.0+
  * loadWorkbook and saveWorkbook now expand paths using
    path.expand
  * readWorksheet provides a new argument 'region' that allows
    to specify area bounds in an alternative way to startRow,
    startCol, endRow and endCol.

0.1-8 2012-02-10
  * Moved to Apache POI 3.8-beta5
  * Improved & extended package vignette
  * Introduced xlcEdit for editing data.frames in an Excel editor,
    e.g. MS Excel.
  * Columns in data.frames that have a type/class with no direct
    correspondence in Excel (i.e. everything which is not a logical,
    numeric, character or Date/POSIXt) are converted to character
    using as.character when writing to Excel rather than the 
    following error being thrown:
    "Unsupported data type (class) detected!"
  * New arguments colTypes, forceConversion and dateTimeFormat
    for methods readNamedRegion and readWorksheet. colTypes allows
    to pre-specify column types (and force them in conjunction with
    forceConversion) when reading in data. forceConversion forces 
    conversion to less generic types (e.g. a string in Excel to a 
    POSIXt in R). dateTimeFormat is a format specifier used when 
    doing date/time conversions.
	
0.1-7 2011-10-19
  * Moved to Apache POI 3.8-beta4
  * Performance improvements when writing large xlsx files. This
    fix was implemented on the Apache POI side.
  * An issue was fixed where the bounding box was not appropriately
    determined when using readWorksheet. The bounding box is now
    determined by first determining start and end row. Afterwards,
    for all rows between the start and the end row the minimum and 
    maximum column is determined.
  * An issue was fixed where the named region was automatically
    expanded by one row when writing data to a named region without
    column headers.
  * New workbook data extraction & replacement operators [, [<-,
    [[, [[<-. These are "syntactic sugar" for the already existing
    methods readWorksheet, writeWorksheet, readNamedRegion and
    writeNamedRegion.
  * Support for saving workbooks to a new file ("save as").
  * Support for querying the last (non-empty) row in a worksheet
  * Support for including the row names of a data.frame when
    writing to a worksheet or a named region. In addition, when
    reading data from a worksheet or a named region a column
    can be specified that should be turned into row names.
  * Extended use of setMissingValue. setMissingValue allows to
    define a set of missing value identifiers that are recognized
    as missing values when reading in data. The first element of
    this set is used as missing value identifier when writing data.
  * Improvements to the definition of several generic functions &
    methods
  * Improvements to the functions writeNamedRegionToFile &
    writeWorksheetToFile. Also, an issue was fixed with
    writeNamedRegionToFile where quoted sheet names (e.g. due to
    a whitespace in the sheet name) would have caused an error.
  * Support for auto-sizing of columns.
  * New functionality to append data to named regions and work-
    sheets: appendNamedRegion & appendWorksheet.
  * Several internal changes on the Java side: removing Java
    logging, using java.util.ArrayList instead of java.util.Vector
  * Functionality for dumping and restoring objects to/from Excel
    files (xlcDump, xlcRestore)
  * Added a package vignette

0.1-5 2011-07-07
  * Support for setting/getting cell formulas. See methods
    set/getCellFormula.
  * Support for setting/getting the force formula recalculation flag on
    worksheets. See methods set/getForceFormulaRecalculation.
  * Support for setting auto-filters via the setAutoFilter method.
  * There is a set of new utility functions:
    - aref2idx, idx2aref: Converts Excel area references (such as A5:D14)
      to row & column based cell references and vice versa.
    - aref: Constructs an Excel area reference from a specification of the
      top left corner and the dimensionality of an object.
    - getReferenceCoordinates: Queries the coordinates of an Excel name
      representing an Excel area reference (such as A5:D14)

0.1-4 2011-05-26
  * An issue was fixed where cell styles would not be applied correctly.
  * There is a new style action called NONE: This style action instructs 
    XLConnect to apply no cell styles when writing data. Cell styles are kept 
    as they are. This is useful in a scenario where all styling is predefined 
    in an Excel template which is then only filled with data.
  * There is a new DATA_FORMAT_ONLY style action: This style action instructs
    XLConnect to only set the data format for a cell but not to apply any other 
    styling but rather keep the existing one. The data format to be applied is 
    determined by the corresponding R data type and can be defined by the user. 
    This style action may be useful in scenarios where Excel templates with 
    pre-defined styling are to be filled with XLConnect.
  * Worksheets can be renamed with the new renameSheet method.
  * The positions (indices) of worksheets can be queried & redefined using the 
    new methods getSheetPos & setSheetPos.
  * Worksheets can be cloned using the new method cloneSheet.
  * There is a set of new utility functions:
    - col2idx, idx2col: Converts Excel column names such as BD to indices and 
      vice versa.
    - cref2idx, idx2cref: Converts cell references to row & column indices and 
      vice versa.
  * Setting a missing value string when writing missing values from R to Excel. 
    By default missing values result in blank/empty cells. This is to have a nice 
    type mapping between R and Excel. In some cases, however, you might want to 
    define a specific missing value string to be used by XLConnect when writing 
    cells representing missing values instead of blank/empty cells. This can be 
    done using the new method setMissingValue.
  * The handling of error cells (cells that result in an error when trying to 
    evaluate them) has been greatly improved. With XLConnect 0.1-3 error cells 
    directly resulted in an exception. With XLConnect 0.1-4 this behavior can 
    be controlled using the onErrorCell method. By default error cells now result 
    in a missing value and the corresponding error cells will be reported via 
    warnings. The behavior may be changed to get an exception with the first 
    occurrence of an error cell.
  * There is two new methods for merging & un-merging cells: mergeCells & 
    unmergeCells.

0.1-3 2011-02-27
